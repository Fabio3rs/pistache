Making Pistache on macOS
========================

Apple's clang compiler must be installed. It comes as part of
Xcode. If not already installed, at terminal command line do:
  xcode-select --install

Homebrew (also known as "brew") is required. If not already installed,
follow the Homebrew instructions to install:
  In your browser: https://brew.sh/

Then, install the necessary brew packages via terminal command line:
  brew install meson
  brew install cmake
  brew install doxygen
  brew install googletest
  brew install openssl
  brew install rapidjson
  brew install howard-hinnant-date
(Note: you can skip cmake if you will only use meson; and you may be
  able to skip howard-hinnant-date)

Convenience shell scripts are provided to make the build. At terminal,
do:
  bldscripts/mesbuild.sh
To test:
  bldscripts/mestest.sh
To install:
  bldscripts/mesinstall.sh

The meaning of each convenience script is as follows:
  mesbuild.sh - build release version using meson
  mestest.sh - test release version using meson
  mesinstall.sh - install release version using meson
  
  mesbuilddebug.sh - build debug version using meson
  mestestdebug.sh - test debug version with meson
  mesinstalldebug.sh - install debug version using meson
  
  mesbuildflibev.sh - build debug version using meson forcing libevnet use
  mestestflibev.sh - test debug version using meson with libevnet use  
  mesinstallflibev.sh - install debug version using meson with libevnet use

  clean.sh - remove build directories
  
  cmkbuild.sh - build release version using cmake
  cmkbuilddebug.sh - build debug version using cmake

If using cmake, you should add some homebrew setup to your .bashrc/.zshrc:

  if [ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]; then
      MYBREWCMD=brew
      if [[ $(uname -m) == 'x86_64' ]]; then
          if [ -e "/usr/local/bin/brew" ]; then
              MYBREWCMD="/usr/local/bin/brew"
          fi
      else
          if [ -e "/opt/homebrew/bin/brew" ]; then
              MYBREWCMD="/opt/homebrew/bin/brew"
          fi
      fi
      if command -v ${MYBREWCMD} &> /dev/null
      then
          # Setup brew environment variables
          #     HOMEBREW_PREFIX, HOMEBREW_CELLAR and HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY
          # Also updates PATH, MANPATH and INFOPATH
          eval "$(${MYBREWCMD} shellenv)"
      fi
      unset MYBREWCMD
  fi

And then also add to your .bashrc/.zshrc:
  if command -v brew &> /dev/null
  then
      export HOMEBREW_LIB_DIR=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib
      export HOMEBREW_INC_DIR=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/include
  
      if [ -d "$HOMEBREW_LIB_DIR" ]
         then
         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOMEBREW_LIB_DIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      fi
  
      if [ -d "$HOMEBREW_INC_DIR" ]
         then
         export CFLAGS="-I$HOMEBREW_INC_DIR $CFLAGS"
         export CXXFLAGS="-I$HOMEBREW_INC_DIR $CXXFLAGS"
         export CPPFLAGS="-I$HOMEBREW_INC_DIR $CPPFLAGS"
      fi
  fi

(If using meson, you likely won't need to do these .bashrc/.zshrc
updates - meson will figure out the environment for you)
